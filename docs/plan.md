Our company has a framework, called VGF, for building games. The games are played on Smart TVs and streaming devices like FireTV with players the remote as a microphone to send voice commands to the game

 Players can also pair a mobile phone (which should have our app installed) through a QR code to connect the phone to a games backend and then use the phone as a microphone.

You can see the code for the framework in /Users/pratik/dev/vgf

We want to develop a TDD to use Unity to render the games. The games could be 2D or 3D. The framework currently supports web based games - we need to port the "client" side code to C# so the Unity runtime can communicate to a server running VGF on the backend.

I want you to analyse the code and write a TDD in the docs folder.

Use deep thinking and do not hallucinate. Use British spelling.
